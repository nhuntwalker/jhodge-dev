                    <p>Emerging from New York's inner-city, Jamal Hodge is a filmmaker who believes that the tribulations of his childhood have formed a deep understanding of pain, identity, and the importance of compassion. In his films Hodge strives to use darkness to show light, to blend the terrible with the sublime, in order to expand the audience's awareness of each other's humanity while reminding them of their own.</p>

                    <p>His short film <strong>"The Kind Ones"</strong> has screened at the <em>Cannes Short Film Corner</em>, <em>The Big Apple Film Festival</em>, and <em>The New York City Horror Film Festival</em> all in 2016. Additionally, his short film <strong>"The Jump"</strong> won the audience award for best Narrative Short Film at the <em>Black Star Film Festival</em> and the <em>Baltimore International Film Festival</em>. The Jump has also been an official selection in festivals such as <em>The Urban World Film Festival</em> and <em>The Martha's Vineyard African American Film Festival</em>. Jamal Hodge's first Narrative feature film as a director, <strong>"Threading Needles"</strong>, a gritty Pan-African drama that explores the complex state of American racism, was one of two runner-ups at the <em>Hollywood Black Film Festival's 2011 Feature Film Competition</em>. Recently, Hodge has performed as an actor opposite theatre legend Patrick Baldauff in the film <strong>"Patrick"</strong> and in the feature film <strong>"Wild Men"</strong> as the film's main antagonist.</p>

                    <p>Jamal has won the <strong>Best Director Award</strong> from the Damn! Film Series in 2016. Among his many awards Hodge has worked on the Emmy Award-winning documentary, <strong>"Bullets In The Hood"</strong> as a cinematographer, and on Discovery Channel's award-winning series <strong>"Off To War"</strong> as an assistant editor. His first documentary <strong>"An African American in Russia"</strong> even took him to <em>The Sundance Film Festival</em>. Jamal has been recognized with a citation award from the <em>Hague Appeal for Peace</em> for his brilliant directorial work in <strong>"The Zapatista Dream 5 Years Later"</strong>. He has received various other accolades and awards including a Gold Spire Award from the <em>San Francisco International Film Festival</em> and the Alumnus Award from <em>Urban Visionaries</em>.</p>

                    <p>An avid believer in education and an advocate for paying it forward, Hodge has also taught filmmaking to literally hundreds of kids from various walks of life, such as <em>Japan's Keio Academy</em>, <em>Big Brothers-Big Sisters</em>, <em>The Pro-TV Program</em>, <em>TRUCE</em>, <em>The COVE</em>, and <em>Mythic Bridge</em>. Despite his humble beginnings, Hodge has risen to become one of film's most promising and dynamic new visionaries. His history of mentoring youth in underprivileged communities speaks to his depth of character and his work abroad sheds light on his ability to cross barriers and explore issues that have long remained undiscovered. As a director, writer, and producer, Jamal Hodge has only just begun to carve out his place in film history.</p>
