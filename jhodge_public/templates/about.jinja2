                    <p><strong>Jamal Hodge</strong> is a filmmaker who believes that the tribulations of his childhood have formed a deep understanding of pain, identity, and the importance of compassion. In his films Hodge strives to use darkness to show light in order to expand the audience’s awareness of their own humanity.</p>

                    <p>His short urban crime drama “Knockout Game” is an official selection of the Cannes Short Film Corner in 2017. Also, his horror film “The Kind Ones” has screened at the Cannes Short Film Corner, the Big Apple Film Festival, and won the Audience Choice award at the New York City Horror Film Festival and the Gold Award at the Spotlight horror awards all in 2016. Additionally, his short film “ The Jump” won the audience award for best Narrative Short Film at the Black Star Film Festival and the Baltimore International Film Festival. The Jump has also been an official selection in festivals such as the Urban World Film Festival and Hollywood Black Film Festival.</p>

                    <p>Outside of the film festival circuit, Hodge has done local and international commercials. Worked on HBO and Discovery content as an editor, and on the Emmy award winning 'Bullets in the hood' as a cinematographer. An avid believer in education and an advocate for paying it forward, Hodge has also taught filmmaking to literally hundreds of kids from various walks of life, such as <em>Japan's Keio Academy</em>, <em>Big Brothers-Big Sisters</em>, <em>The Pro-TV Program</em>, <em>TRUCE</em>, <em>The COVE</em>, and <em>Mythic Bridge</em>. Despite his humble beginnings, Hodge has risen to become one of film's most promising and dynamic new visionaries. His history of mentoring youth in underprivileged communities speaks to his depth of character and his work abroad sheds light on his ability to cross barriers and explore issues that have long remained undiscovered. As a director, writer, and producer, Jamal Hodge has only just begun to carve out his place in film history.</p>
